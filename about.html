        <p>I'm Shilpa, a seventeen-year-old writer and graphic designer. I hail from College Station, Texas; I'm currently a freshman at the University of Pennsylvania, where I study linguistics and computer science. My greatest loves are <a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10669418-shilpa">books</a>, the French Revolution, and droids (fictional or otherwise).</p>
		    <p>I've been producing art for as long as I can remember, but I only realized how much I loved graphic design when my dad came home one day with a Wacom tablet. It came with a free copy of Photoshop Elements. The rest, as they say, is history.</p>
        <p>I honed my Adobe Creative Suite skills throughout high school, where I wrote, designed, and photographed for the school newspaper. During this time, I began designing T-shirts -- both for sale (<a href = "http://www.redbubble.com/people/crispians">here</a>) and for commission. After noticing the severe lack of simple, clean themes on several blogging platforms, I began designing those, too.</p>
